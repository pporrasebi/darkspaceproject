## Comparison of protein association datasets and their enrichment in IMEx curated interactions
## Estimating the size of the uncurated interactome

========================================================

The aim of this analysis is to compare publications and interacting pair datasets produced by a number of resources. These resources potentially indicate which protein-protein interactions have been reported but not curated in IMEx. Some of these resources also provide source papers describing the interaction.

IMPORTANT: This script assumes that different referenced datasets have been freshly updated. If you need to update results of this set, please re-run the corresponding source as well.

The following datasets are included in the analysis:
