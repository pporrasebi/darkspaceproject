Hi Pablo,

I am currently at a hackathon. I will run the pipeline once I am back 
next week. I will try my best to give you the results before the xmas 
break which for me starts by 18th. If not surely by the 3rd week of 
Jan.  I should be able to give the details you have listed below, fyi 
the pipeline runs on the Open Access subset of full text article. I will 
have to check if it runs on abstract as well (but I highly doubt it).

Regards,

Aravind
