I recall our discussion now and it would be useful if you could come up 
with an interaction keyword list such as the one in :
http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm06/workproceed/Text%20Mining/otasek6.pdf

acetylate, (co)activate, transactivate, associate, add, bind, link, 
catalyze, cleave, coimmunoprecipitate, demethylate, dephosphorylate, 
methylate, phosphorylate, produce, modify, impair, inactivate, interact, 
react, disassemble, discharge, modulate, substitute, dissociate, 
ubiquitinate, heterodimerize, heterotrimerize, immunoprecipitate

Cheers,
Senay

      Would 2pm on Thursday work for you? We assume we only need about
      20-30 minutes of your time. We are in Office 29 in the new

          We are interested in following up your suggestions for mining
          PPIs that we are missing, or have under-represented in the
          current IntAct network. Would you be free to pop over one day
