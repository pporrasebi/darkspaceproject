Hi,

yes this format is different. sorry, no time to generate it in the 
previous format.

1. PMC ID
2.pubmed id
3.publication date
4.interacting protein pair, separated by ||
5. all the supporting sentences for that specific pair extracted from 
that specific article, separated by ||||
6.section information where those sentences is coming from, separated by 
||||
7. the interacting pairs extracted from those sentences (proteins are 
separated by ||), pairs are separated by ||||
8. Offsets of those proteins separated by |||| (e.g. 
19_21##196_200||||........)  here 19_21 is the start and end index of 
the first protein in the sentence and 196_200  is the offset of its 
interacting protein.
rest is ignorable, these are the counts and scores generated by the 
pipeline for the confidence calculation. You probably no need them.


If there is an alternative uniprot ID, then it should be separated by 
comma (,). I remember I took this into account but cannot double check now.

let me know if still is not clear, I will try to answer you to night.
