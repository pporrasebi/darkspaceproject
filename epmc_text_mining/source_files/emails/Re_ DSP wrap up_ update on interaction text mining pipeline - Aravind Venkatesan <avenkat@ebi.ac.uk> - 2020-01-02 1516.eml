Hello Pablo,

Happy new year, I hope you had a good winter break. As a new year gift I 
have the data you had asked for :-), you may access the annotations here 
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ax0tFAE1MUXpoevF7g5wikMuryr6s7Xq?usp=sharing>. 
For the specific question you had, see below:

The Text-mining pipeline was run on *open access fulltext* subset: 
*Sept. 2019* .

The*Sept. 2019* subset contains*~2.5 million* (2,553,046) articles. The 
final number of articles annotated: *52,403*. The pipeline was run from 
10th - 16th Dec. 2019

For identifying gene names. A dictionary approached was used, generated 
from the UniPort data file (filtered for humans genes). The dictionary 
accounts for gene names (incl. synonyms, Alt names, ORF names etc..) and 
the corresponding Uniprot Accession numbers.

Please let me know if you require any other information. Also I am happy 
to contribute to the proposal.
